**Catch leaked secrets, dangerous CI workflows, and insecure infrastructure
before they ship -- with one command and zero runtime dependencies.**

BlueRayScan reads a repository the way a security reviewer skims it. It covers
credentials, application code, dependencies, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure
Pipelines, Jenkins, CircleCI, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation,
Ansible and more without enlarging the supply chain it audits.

- **Fast to try:** scan any checkout without configuration.
- **Built for CI:** text, JSON, SARIF, Markdown, GitHub annotations and JUnit.
- **Honest by design:** reports skipped files, confidence and suppressions.

## Quick start

```bash
pipx run bluerayscan scan . --fail-on high
```

That is a complete scan. Add configuration and a baseline only when the project
needs them.

## Install

From PyPI with `pipx`:

```bash
pipx install bluerayscan
```

Or with `pip`:

```bash
pip install bluerayscan
```

The primary command is `bluerayscan`. The existing `repo-sentinel` command is
kept as a compatibility alias.

From a checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KhanSaahib/bluerayscan.git
cd bluerayscan
pip install .
```

Or from a tag, without a checkout:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/KhanSaahib/bluerayscan@v0.4.0
```

Or run it straight from a checkout, with no install at all:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m bluerayscan scan .
```

## Use

Start here:

```bash
bluerayscan init .
```

That scans the repository, tells you what is in it -- including which three
rules are doing most of the talking, because a hundred findings that are all
one rule is a decision to make once -- records the findings at or above `high`
as a baseline so your first pipeline run is green, writes a
`.bluerayscan.json`, and prints the CI snippet for whichever CI system the
repository already has -- GitHub Actions, GitLab, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI or
Jenkins, the last four wired to draw the report rather than print it. Nothing
is overwritten without `--force`.

Then, day to day:

```bash
bluerayscan scan .                          # scan the working directory
bluerayscan scan ../other-project           # scan somewhere else
bluerayscan rules                           # what does this thing check for?
bluerayscan rules kubernetes                # ...or just that family
bluerayscan rules WF011                     # one rule, explained in full
bluerayscan init .                          # set a repository up
git log -p | bluerayscan history            # what did history commit? (below)
bluerayscan explain VALUE --name api_key    # why was it quiet about this? (below)

bluerayscan scan . --format json            # machine-readable output
bluerayscan scan . --format sarif --output results.sarif
bluerayscan scan . --format markdown         # a pull request comment
bluerayscan scan . --format github          # annotations on the diff
bluerayscan scan . --format junit           # a test report, for other CIs
bluerayscan scan . --min-severity high      # only show what matters most
bluerayscan scan . --min-confidence high    # only show what it is sure of
bluerayscan scan . --fail-on critical       # relax the CI gate
bluerayscan scan . --fail-on none           # report, never fail
bluerayscan scan . --exclude 'fixtures'     # skip a directory (repeatable)
bluerayscan scan . --max-file-size 8M       # read the big ones too
bluerayscan scan . --no-gitignore           # also scan git-ignored files
bluerayscan scan . --no-example-allowlist   # include documented and invented keys
bluerayscan scan . --no-suppression         # read past the ignore markers
bluerayscan scan . --no-color               # or set NO_COLOR in the environment

bluerayscan scan . --write-baseline         # accept what is already there
bluerayscan scan . --baseline               # fail only on what is new
bluerayscan scan . --prune-baseline         # drop entries that match nothing

bluerayscan scan . --disable K8S004         # switch off a rule or family
bluerayscan scan . --quiet                  # the summary, and what it is mostly
bluerayscan scan . --sort path              # group by file, to read rather than triage
git diff --name-only origin/main | bluerayscan scan . --paths-from -
```

That last line is the fast per-pull-request run: the scan is restricted to the
files the branch touched. A listed path that no longer exists is skipped, since
a diff lists deletions too, and a listed path that `.gitignore` covers is
scanned anyway -- you named it.

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings at or above `--fail-on` (default `medium`),
`2` usage error, unreadable baseline, or unwritable output. `--fail-on none`
reports without ever returning `1`, which is what the job that uploads SARIF or
posts the comment wants -- a `2` still means the run itself went wrong. That makes it a
one-line CI gate:

```yaml
- run: pipx run bluerayscan scan . --fail-on high
```

Sample output:

```
CRITICAL SEC001  terraform/main.tf:14
    AWS access key id
    evidence: AKIA************LM3D
    fix: Deactivate the key in IAM, then rotate it. Deleting the commit is not enough.

HIGH SEC101  .env.staging:7  (medium confidence)
    High-entropy value position assigned to 'DATABASE_PASSWORD'
    evidence: Tv8n************Lz4T
    fix: Move the value to an environment variable or secret store.

MEDIUM WF001  .github/workflows/release.yml:22
    Action 'actions/checkout@v4' is pinned to a mutable tag
    evidence: - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    fix: Tags can be moved to point at new code. Pin to a full commit SHA and let Dependabot propose upgrades.

3 finding(s): 1 critical, 1 high, 1 medium
Scanned 412 file(s) in 0.31s.
```

That last line is not decoration. A run that scanned nothing looks exactly like
a clean repository, and "no findings" from a mistyped path is the most
dangerous answer this tool can give.

## What history committed

A credential in the working tree may never have been pushed. A credential in
history has been on every clone, every fork, every CI cache and every mirror
made since the day it landed, and deleting the file does not take it back.
Those are different problems, and only the second one is certain.

```bash
git log -p --date=iso | bluerayscan history
```

This tool does not run git. It never has -- `.gitignore` is implemented by
hand rather than by asking git, and `--paths-from` exists precisely so the
caller runs `git diff` -- and reading history is the same bargain: you run
git, this reads what comes out. It takes a file too, or `-` for standard
input, and every flag `scan` has for thresholds and formats.

Each finding names the commit that introduced it:

```
CRITICAL SEC001  config/settings.py:14
    AWS access key id
    added in: 4f2c8ab on 2026-03-04
    evidence: AKIA****************7EXAMPLE
    fix: Delete the key in IAM...
```

A value added, reverted and added again is reported once, against the earliest
commit that carried it, because that is the date a rotation decision turns on.

**Only the credential rules run here.** A container that ran as root in 2021
and does not today is fixed; a workflow that was once hijackable and was then
repaired is repaired. Configuration in history is history. A credential in
history is a credential until somebody rotates it, and that is the question
worth asking of a diff.

What it reads is the lines each commit *added*, at the line numbers they
landed on -- so a finding points at a real line of a real version of the file,
and a multi-line value added in one commit still reads as one value. Lines a
commit removed are not its news; lines it left alone are not either.

## Why was it quiet about this?

Silence is the one answer a scanner cannot distinguish from *there was nothing
there*. For a value you have in your hand, `explain` prints the measurements
the heuristic rules take and says what would happen to it:

```
$ bluerayscan explain 'Xk92mQp7Lz4TvB8nRw1Y' --name api_key
Xk92************Rw1Y
  length      20 characters (minimum 12)
  alphabet    62 symbols (letters and digits)
  entropy     4.32 bits per character
  floor       3.24 bits -- 0.75 of the 4.32 a value this long over this alphabet could reach
  shape       matches no documented token shape
  name        'api_key' promises a credential: yes

Reported: high-entropy value assigned to 'api_key' (SEC100 or SEC101, depending
on whether it is quoted), at medium confidence.
```

`--name` matters as much as the value. The entropy rules ask about a value
only where the name beside it promises a credential, so the same string
assigned to `build_id` is a build id, and the command says so rather than
leaving it a mystery. The value is redacted on the way out, like everything
else this tool prints, and the exit code answers the question on its own: `1`
if it would be reported, `0` if not.

It takes `-` to read the value from standard input, which is the shape to
reach for when the value is one you would rather not put in your shell
history.

## Severity and confidence

Every finding carries both, because they answer different questions and
collapsing them into one number loses both.

**Severity** is what it costs you if the finding is real: a live AWS key is
critical whether the rule was certain or guessing. **Confidence** is how sure
the rule is that it found a real instance. A documented token shape — a GitHub
PAT, a Stripe live key — is high confidence; a high-entropy string next to a
variable named `api_key` is a heuristic, and says so.

Confidence also moves with where a file sits. A credential in `testdata/` or a
README is usually invented, and a pipeline under `docs/` is a tutorial snippet
rather than something that runs, so both drop a step. Neither is silenced --
that is what `--min-confidence` is for, and a real key does get committed to a
fixture directory.

The split is what makes the tool tunable without making it useless. A pipeline
that wants a hard gate can run `--fail-on high --min-confidence high` and be
woken only for things the scanner can defend, while a human audit runs with
neither flag and reads everything.

## What gets scanned

The walk skips binaries, files over 2 MB, and a built-in list of generated or
vendored directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `dist`, `target`, …).
The size limit is reported rather than assumed: every run says how many files
it skipped and names the first, and `--max-file-size 8M` reads them. A binary
is the one silent skip, because its bytes are not text in any sense a rule
could read.

It also honours `.gitignore`, including nested ones, which each govern their own
subtree. The rules implemented are negation with `!`, anchoring with a leading or
embedded `/`, directory-only patterns ending in `/`, the `*`, `?` and `[...]`
wildcards, and `**` for arbitrary depth; across the ignore files in scope, the
last matching pattern wins. Not implemented: `.git/info/exclude`, the global
`core.excludesFile`, and git's rule that an already-tracked file stays tracked
however it is ignored — all three would mean shelling out to git.

This is a deliberate narrowing of scope, and it cuts both ways. A secret in an
ignored file was never committed, so reporting it is a false positive, and the
noise from a local `.env` is what makes people stop reading the output. But an
ignore rule is also the easiest way to hide something from this tool, whether by
accident or on purpose. Audit what the scanner was told not to look at:

```bash
bluerayscan scan . --no-gitignore
```

## What it checks

One hundred and forty-six rules across sixteen families. [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md) is the
full list, with a paragraph on each family explaining what it is looking for
and why; `bluerayscan rules` prints the same catalogue from the tool.

| Family | Rules | Looks at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Secrets](docs/RULES.md#secrets) | SEC001–SEC054, SEC100–SEC101 | Credentials in any text file, including inside base64 |
| [File names](docs/RULES.md#file-names) | FN001–FN004 | Key material and credential files, which have no text to read |
| [Shell scripts](docs/RULES.md#shell-scripts-and-makefiles) | SH001–SH004 | Where `curl \| sh` actually lives |
| [Application code](docs/RULES.md#application-code) | AP001–AP008 | Verification off, weak TLS, debug on, predictable tokens, unsafe loads, forgeable tokens |
| [Dependencies](docs/RULES.md#dependencies) | SC001–SC004 | Where the rest of the build comes from, in nine manifests |
| [GitHub Actions](docs/RULES.md#github-actions-workflows) | WF001–WF013 | Script injection, token scope, privileged triggers |
| [GitLab CI](docs/RULES.md#gitlab-ci) | GL001–GL004 | The same injection class, and debug tracing |
| [Azure Pipelines](docs/RULES.md#azure-pipelines) | AZ001–AZ004 | The same injection, a third time |
| [Jenkins](docs/RULES.md#jenkins) | JK001–JK003 | Groovy's quoting, which decides if it is a bug |
| [CircleCI](docs/RULES.md#circleci) | CC001–CC004 | The same injection, a fourth time, plus moving orbs |
| [Dockerfiles](docs/RULES.md#dockerfiles) | DK001–DK006 | Base images, root, pipe-to-shell, layer secrets |
| [Docker Compose](docs/RULES.md#docker-compose) | DC001–DC006 | Privilege, host mounts, ports on every interface |
| [Terraform](docs/RULES.md#terraform) | TF001–TF008 | Open ingress, public storage, wildcard policies |
| [Ansible](docs/RULES.md#ansible) | AN001–AN003 | Decisions applied to every host at once |
| [CloudFormation](docs/RULES.md#cloudformation) | CF001–CF006 | The same, in AWS's other vocabulary |
| [Kubernetes](docs/RULES.md#kubernetes) | K8S001–K8S012 | Container escape routes, secrets in manifests, chart values, overlays |

Three things are worth knowing before you read the list.

**Structure, not lines.** The Terraform, Kubernetes, Compose, CloudFormation
and pipeline rules read block structure, through three small standard-library
readers. It is the difference between `privileged: true` under
`securityContext`, which is critical, and the same line under `annotations`,
which is nothing. The workflow family is the exception and says so: it reads
GitHub Actions files the way a reviewer skims them, splitting jobs and steps by
indentation.

**Recognition by content.** Kubernetes manifests are found by `apiVersion` plus
`kind`, Compose files by their `services` map, GitLab pipelines by name or by
shape. Not by directory: a workflow file that happens to live in `k8s/` is not
a workload.

**Honest edges.** None of this evaluates Terraform, renders a chart, or runs a
pipeline. A value arriving through a variable is invisible, and the rules say
so rather than implying coverage they do not have.

## Project defaults

Every project that adopts a scanner ends up with a preferred invocation. Putting
it in a `Makefile` means the pre-commit hook, the pipeline and whoever runs the
tool by hand all disagree. Put it in `.bluerayscan.json` beside the tree
instead:

```json
{
  "fail_on": "high",
  "min_confidence": "medium",
  "exclude": ["vendor", "testdata"],
  "disable": ["K8S004", "DC006"]
}
```

The settings are `exclude`, `fail_on` (`"none"` included), `min_severity`,
`min_confidence`, `baseline`, `max_file_size`, `sort`, `disable`, `gitignore`
and `example_allowlist`. An unknown
key is an error rather than a shrug: a typo in a security tool's configuration
means a project believes it configured something it did not.

Everything here is a *default*. Anything on the command line wins, so a config
file can never stop someone auditing their own repository more strictly than the
project usually does.

Rules can also be switched off for one subtree rather than everywhere, which is
usually what is actually wanted -- a vendored chart, an examples directory, a
fixtures tree:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "examples/**": { "disable": ["K8S*"] },
    "charts/vendor/**": { "disable": ["*"] }
  }
}
```

The globs are the `.gitignore` dialect, matched by the same code, so
`examples/`, `charts/vendor/**` and `*.tf` mean here exactly what they mean
there. Inventing a second glob dialect for one config key is how a tool ends up
with two subtly different answers to "does this path match".

`disable` takes rule ids or family prefixes (`DC*`), and `--disable` does the
same ad hoc. A disabled rule is still counted in the output -- *"3 finding(s)
hidden by disabled rules"* -- because silence nobody can see is the failure mode
this whole tool exists to avoid. An id that matches no rule is called out too:
that typo leaves the rule switched on, which is the safe direction but not the
one you meant.

## Baselines

A scanner introduced to a repository that has been running for years reports its
entire history at once, and a build that has been red since Tuesday tells nobody
anything. Record what is already there, then fail only on what arrives after:

```bash
bluerayscan scan . --write-baseline      # writes .bluerayscan-baseline.json
git add .bluerayscan-baseline.json
bluerayscan scan . --baseline            # exits 0; new findings still fail
```

Two properties make the file safe to commit. It never contains a secret —
entries hold a hash of the already-redacted evidence, along with the rule and
the path, so there is nothing to recover. And it does not pin line numbers, so
reformatting a file does not resurrect its accepted findings, while moving a
secret to another file does not keep it accepted.

Every run reports how many findings the baseline is holding, and every entry
that matched nothing this time is reported as stale — usually because the
finding was genuinely fixed. That is how a baseline shrinks instead of
calcifying. It is a list of debts, not a list of exemptions.

An unreadable or corrupt baseline is an error, not an empty baseline. Failing
open would mean a truncated file silently accepts everything.

## The JSON output

`--format json` is the one to build on. Alongside the findings it carries a
`scan` object -- how many files were read, how long it took, what was skipped
for being unreadable or too large, and how many lines carry a suppression
marker. A person reads that as a sentence under the report; a pipeline cannot,
and a pipeline that cannot tell "no findings" from "nothing was read" is
exactly what that sentence exists to prevent.

Each finding carries:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "SEC001",
  "severity": "critical",
  "confidence": "high",
  "title": "AWS access key id",
  "path": "terraform/main.tf",
  "line": 14,
  "evidence": "AKIA************LM3D",
  "remediation": "Deactivate the key in IAM, then rotate it. ...",
  "fingerprint": "8f120d646369be74",
  "occurrences": 1
}
```

`occurrences` is how many places in that file hold the same value. One
credential pasted six hundred times is one credential to rotate, so it is
reported once, at the first of them, with the count attached.

The `fingerprint` is the same identity a baseline uses: a hash of the rule, the
path and the already-redacted evidence, with no line number in it, so it
survives reformatting and changes when the value does. Paths always use forward
slashes, on every platform, so a report reads the same wherever it was
produced. `bluerayscan rules --format json` describes the rules themselves,
including the CWE each one reports and, for each family in the listing, what
it reads and where it is written up -- so a consumer grouping by category need
not invent a label the documentation does not use.

## Posting the result onto a pull request

`--format markdown` writes a table meant to be pasted into a comment, where the
people arguing about the change are already looking:

```yaml
- id: scan
  run: bluerayscan scan . --format markdown --output report.md --fail-on none
- uses: actions/github-script@<sha>
  with:
    script: |
      const body = require("fs").readFileSync("report.md", "utf8");
      github.rest.issues.createComment({ ...context.repo, issue_number: context.issue.number, body });
```

The table carries what triage needs -- how bad, which rule, where -- and the
fixes go underneath in a collapsed block, once per rule rather than once per
finding. Long reports are truncated with a count: a comment that needs scrolling
past four hundred rows is one nobody reads.

### Annotations, without asking for a permission

`--format sarif` needs `security-events: write`, which a workflow triggered by
a fork's pull request does not have. `--format github` writes the same findings
as workflow commands, which the runner turns into annotations on the diff and
which need no permission at all:

```yaml
- run: bluerayscan scan . --format github
```

Same findings, worse home, far fewer prerequisites.

### Every other CI: a test report

GitLab, Azure Pipelines and Jenkins all render JUnit XML natively, as a list of
failures with a message and a body -- which is a finding with its remediation
attached. No plugin, no permission:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
scan:
  script: bluerayscan scan . --format junit --output report.xml
  artifacts:
    when: always
    reports:
      junit: report.xml
```

One test case per finding, classed by family so the CI groups them the way the
catalogue does, and a clean run is a single passing case rather than an empty
suite -- an empty report renders as a broken job rather than a quiet one.

## Reporting to the GitHub Security tab

`--format sarif` emits SARIF 2.1.0, which GitHub's code scanning ingests and
turns into annotations on the pull request that introduced the line:

```yaml
- run: bluerayscan scan . --format sarif --output bluerayscan.sarif --fail-on none
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@<sha>
  with:
    sarif_file: bluerayscan.sarif
```

The job needs `security-events: write`, and `--fail-on none` on the scan step so
that a finding does not stop the run before it has published anything — put the
actual gate in a separate job. This repository's own
[CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) does exactly that.

Each result carries a `partialFingerprint`, so code scanning follows a finding
across the reformattings and line moves that would otherwise close it and
immediately reopen it as new.

The run also reports what it could not read, as SARIF `toolExecutionNotifications`.
A Security tab showing no alerts because nothing was scanned looks exactly like
one showing no alerts because everything is fine, and those notifications are
the difference.

## Suppressing a false positive

Three scopes, in increasing blast radius. All three work in any file the scanner
reads, workflows and Dockerfiles included, and none of them cares what the
comment syntax is.

One line:

```python
sample_token = "Xk92mQp7Lz4TvB8nRw1Y"  # bluerayscan: ignore
```

A block, for a generated section or a fixture full of invented keys. Both
markers are themselves suppressed, along with everything between them:

```python
# bluerayscan: ignore-start
FAKE_KEYS = {"aws": "...", "stripe": "..."}
# bluerayscan: ignore-end
```

A whole file, with `bluerayscan: ignore-file` — but **only in the first 20
lines**. Below that it is just a mention, which is why this README still gets
scanned despite the line you are reading. Without that rule, any file that
described the directive would silently stop being scanned, and a scanner a
sentence about it can switch off is worse than no scanner. Keeping the directive
in the header also means you can see that a file is unscanned without reading to
the bottom of it.

The former `repo-sentinel: ignore` spelling remains supported indefinitely, so
upgrading cannot silently reactivate findings a project already reviewed.

All three can name the rules they mean, in brackets:

```yaml
image: nginx:latest  # bluerayscan: ignore[K8S008]
```

Prefer this to the blunt form. A line exempted from everything stays exempt when
a later release adds a rule that would have caught something real there, and the
comment no longer records why the exemption exists. Family prefixes work too
(`ignore[K8S*]`), and so do lists (`ignore[SEC100, DK002]`); the syntax is the
same one `disable` uses in the config file.

Every run says how many lines carry a marker, whether or not it obeyed them,
and `--no-suppression` reads past all of them. A scanner that can be switched
off invisibly is worse than no scanner, which is the same reason
`--no-gitignore` exists.

A block that is opened and never closed silences everything after it, so it is
reported as SEC900 rather than trusted. Close the block, or say `ignore-file` and
mean it.

Reach for a baseline instead when the finding is real but not yet fixed. A
suppression marker says "this is not a problem"; a baseline says "this is a
problem I have not got to". Recording the second as the first is how a repository
forgets.

## Development

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

CI runs the suite on Python 3.9, 3.11 and 3.13, holds a line-coverage floor,
scans this repository with the tool itself, and publishes the result to the
Security tab.

```bash
python3 tools/coverage.py --show-missing
```

The coverage tool is standard library only, like everything else here. Writing
one is a strange thing to do when a good one exists; the reason is that the
promise "this pulls nothing into your environment" should hold for the tests
too, so a contributor with no network can still check the floor.

The test suite includes a corpus that trips **every** rule in the catalogue, and
asserts in five directions: no scanner may emit a rule the catalogue does not
describe, no catalogue entry may describe a rule nothing can emit, no rule may
be missing from [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md), no rule may be more severe in
practice than the catalogue promises, and the severity in the documentation has
to be the severity in the code. Adding a rule without documenting it fails the
build, and so does leaving an entry behind after deleting one -- as does a
number quoted in the README that the catalogue has moved past.

[docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) explains how the pieces fit and why they are
shaped that way; [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers how a new rule earns
its place.
