"""The catalogue of every rule the scanners can emit.

Scanners carry their own detection logic and their own remediation text, which
is where that material belongs -- next to the pattern it explains. What they
cannot carry is a *list*: nothing in the codebase could answer "what does this
tool check for" without running it against a file that happens to trip every
rule.

So the catalogue exists separately, for the two consumers that need the rule
rather than the finding: SARIF, which describes rules once and then references
them, and ``bluerayscan rules``, which prints the table that would otherwise
live only in the README and rot there.

The obvious failure mode of a hand-maintained catalogue is drift, so the test
suite asserts in both directions: every rule the scanners emit is described
here, and every rule described here is one a scanner can emit.
