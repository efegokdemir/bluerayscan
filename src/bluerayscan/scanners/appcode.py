"""Audit application source for the decisions that disable a defence.

Every other scanner here reads configuration. This one reads code, which is a
different proposition: configuration says what a system *is*, and code says
what it does, and a line-at-a-time reader can only honestly answer questions
about idioms rather than about behaviour. So the rules are few, each a
well-known idiom with a well-known meaning, each written per language rather
than guessed at across all of them. The bar for adding one is that the idiom
has a single meaning in the language it is read in: requests' ``verify``
keyword set to false is a Python spelling, and the same characters in a Go
file are a guess. (Written out like that on purpose -- spelled the usual way,
this sentence would be a finding in this scanner's own source, which is a
thing worth knowing about a scanner that reads for idioms.)

What they have in common is that they are all *deliberate*. Nobody disables
certificate verification by accident; it is typed to get past a failure, on a
Tuesday, with a note to put it back. The note is the part that gets lost, and
a scanner that reads the diff six months later is the only thing that will
ever ask about it again.

The limits are the usual ones, and they are real. There is no parser here, so
a construct spread over several lines is invisible, a helper called
``insecure_session()`` is invisible, and a value arriving through a variable is
invisible. A clean report from this family means "none of these idioms
appears", which is a smaller claim than "this code verifies certificates".
